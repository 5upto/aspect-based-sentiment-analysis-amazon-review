# aspect-based-sentiment-analysis-amazon-review
This project explores sentiment analysis to classify feedback as positive or negative. By examining 
review patterns and applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the study aims to 
provide insights into customer sentiment. Initial data preprocessing includes tokenization, 
stemming, vectorization, transforming text data into a format suitable for machine learning. To 
address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is utilized, 
enhancing model performance. Decision Tree classifier and Random Forest Classifier are employed 
for sentiment prediction, achieving high accuracy on the testing dataset. The findings demonstrate 
the effectiveness of combining NLP preprocessing with machine learning to classify sentiment, 
showcasing potential applications in customer service and product feedback analysis.
